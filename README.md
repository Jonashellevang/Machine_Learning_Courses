# Machine Learning 1, 2 and 3 Class Projects

Machine learning can be many things, and during my masters in Business Analytics & Big Data I touched base with many topics, where some of them were performed in assignments. These can all be viewed in the list below:

### Machine Learning 1:
* [Cluster Analysis on Stores of a Retail Company Located in Bogot√° (Dataiku)](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Cluster%20Analysis%20(Dataiku))
* [Regression - Real Estate in Madrid (Dataiku)](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Regression%20-%20Real%20Estate%20in%20Madrid%20(Dataiku))

### Machine Learning 2:
* [HR Analytics - Predicting Turnover For A Large Company (Kaggle - Jupyter Notebooks)](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Classification%20(sklearn%2Cmatplotlib))
* [Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table (DrivenData - Jupyter Notebooks)](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Classification%20(sklearn%2Cmatplotlib))


### Machine Learning 3:
* [Convolutional Neural Nets in TensorFlow and Google Colaboratory](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/CNN%20(Tensorflow%2CKeras))
